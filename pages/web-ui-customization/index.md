Immediate redirect can be turned on if you want your users to be redirected back to "Success" or "Failed" URL, depending on the automatic check results. Redirection is done immediately after they submit the verification and pass the automatic check. This way they won't be seeing the waiting window for human supervision confirmation.

#### Skip waiting for results

With this option turned on, your user will be immediately redirected to "unverifiedUrl" after they submit the verification. This way they won't be waiting for automatic check results. This option is used together with immediate redirect.

#### Show iDenfy water mark

#### Show header timer

This option allows the users to see their session time left.

#### Show footer

This option allows you to enable or disable bottom copyright text on verification screens.
