- (*COMPANY*) Check information about a company, as well as any hits identified on the company.
- (*LID*) Lost and Invalid documents registry check (elligible for **Lithuanian** documents only)

### Calling the API:

{: .important }
> Fraud check endpoint was changed from `https://fraud.markid.eu/V1/check` to `https://ivs.markid.eu/fraud/check`
>
> Send a *HTTP Post* request to: `https://ivs.markid.eu/fraud/check`
>
> The request must contain **basic auth** headers where *username* is **API key** and *password* is **API secret**.

{: .note }  
> ***API key*** and ***API secret*** can be retrieved by contacting *Mark ID tech support* or *Mark ID sales team*:
> - sales@markid.lt
> - info@markid.lt
> - via Dashboard

The request must contain JSON with parameters:

|Key       |Required|Type          |Explanation|
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
|`mode`    |Yes     |`String`      |Specifies how fraud check will be performed. <br/>If `IDENTIFICATION` is given, you will have to provide a scanRef in the data field. <br/>If `DATA` is given, you will have to provide all necessary data about client for required services.|
|`services`|Yes     |`List[String]`|Types of services to apply. <br/>`AML` - Anti money laundering service, <br/>`COMPANY` - Company check, <br/> `LID` - Lost and invalid documents registry(**Lithuanian** documents only).|
|`data`    |Yes     |`List[Dict]`  |Supplied data for fraud check services. The list should consist of one element only.|

#### Specifying AML services

By default if `AML` service is specified in `services` - a name check against global databases for PEPs and Sanctions is performed.
> To have specific `AML` services applied in `data` entry specify names of the services:

|AML service name   |Type    |Default|Constraints|
|-------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
|`nameCheck`        |`Bool`  |`true` |-          |
|`negativeNews`     |`Bool`  |`false`|-          |

#### Filtering AML results

AML nameCheck results can be filtered in multiple ways, by supplying the filters in `data` entry

|Key              |Type         |Constraints |Explanation|
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
|`probability`    |`Int`        |1-100       |The higher the number, the more similar the found name has to be to the provided one. Default is 95.|
|`dateOfBirth`    |`String`     |`YYYY-MM-DD`|If the result has a birth date and it clashes with the provided one, the result is not returned.|
|`nationality`    |`String`     |length = 3  |If the result has a nationality and it clashed with the provided one, the result is not returned.|

#### Specifying LID services

If `LID` service is specified in `services` and `mode` is specified as `DATA` - a `country` parameter should be also provided in `data` entry. This is because a `LID` service is associated to a single country.

|LID data key   |Type    |Default|Constraints         |
|---------------|--------|-------|--------------------|
|`country`      |`String`|-      |Country alpha-2 code|
