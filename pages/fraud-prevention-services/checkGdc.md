### Utility of global data sources check during verification process

This service is used to verify personâ€™s identity data against the databases from more than 200 government and commercial sources.

If you already have this functionality on your environment, there is a possibility to get automatic check. It compares provided information and entries from databases of global data sources. In your [webhook callback](/pages/fraud-prevention-services/ResultCallback), you will receive a field - `gdcMatch` that can have values - `true`, `false` or `null`. 


### Separate API request data and examples

The request is sent to `https://ivs.markid.eu/api/v2/check-gdc-api` and it must contain *basic auth* headers where *username* is *API key* and *password* is *API secret*.

| Mandatory parameters                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name` - First name, `surname` - Last name **and/or** `ssnNumber` - National ID/Number, social security number, `dateOfBirth` - Date of Birth (MM/DD/YYYY) |

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Smith",
  "dateOfBirth":"1958-10-12",
  "ssnNumber": "1234567890"
}
```

#### Example response
The service also returns a reliability score of the checked person:

|Score|Description|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
10|(Good/Correct/Pass)|Messages and match types indicate that this is a passing match combination based on the defined rule set.|
20 | (Probable/Possible) | Messages and match types are sufficient to consider this as a possible match/pass.|
30 | (Did not Pass/Doubtful) | There may or may not have been matched elements but it is doubtful this is sufficient information.|

You will receive HTTP response 200 and JSON body with the following data:
