It is a combination of manual and automatic verification results. Please refer to `autoFace`, `manualFace`, `autoDocument` and `manualDocument` statuses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `SUSPECTED`                            | Overall status of the verification. It depends on auto or manual webhook, but if face status:`autoFace`, `manualFace` is `FACE_MATCH` and document status `autoDocument`, `manualDocument` is `DOC_VALIDATED`, then the verification is approved. If other statuses exist, for example: `DOC_NOT_FOUND`, `FACE_MISMATCH`, then verification is declined. If any `fraudTags` or `mismatchTags` exist for the verification, then status can be set as `SUSPECTED`, because the identification caught some discrepancies. <strong>If verification is approved(`FACE_MATCH` and `DOC_VALIDATED`) but overall status `SUSPECTED` it should be decided on your end to allow or decline this client.</strong> |
| `REVIEWING`                            | Verification is being reviewed by a human.
