# Create verification session 

If you have ***API key*** and ***API secret*** you can create a verification token.

{: .note }
> ***API key*** and ***API secret*** can be retrieved by contacting *Mark ID tech support* or *Mark ID sales team*:
> - sales@markid.lt
> - info@markid.lt
> - via Dashboard

### Graphical representation of token generation (UML activity)

<img alt="Token generation UML activity diagram" width="450" src='https://documentation.markid.eu/resources/TokenGenerationUmlActivityDiagram.jpg' />

### Sending request
Send a *HTTP POST* request to: `https://ivs.markid.eu/api/v2/token` 

The request must contain *basic auth* headers where *username* is *API key* and *password* is *API secret*.


#### We recommend:
Provide only clientId value while generating a token. 
Do not provide whole client information. Often clients make mistakes and cannot pass the verification successfully.
Use client information (name, surname and etc.) from our system's [webhook](/pages/verification-service-api/ResultCallback). This would prevent errors and improve user experience.

{: .caution }
If provided information is incorrect or different than information found in the document, you would get verification `overall` status `SUSPECTED` with `mismatchTags`: `DOC_INFO_MISMATCH`

The request must contain JSON with optional and mandatory parameters:

that were optional and not specified during token generation. Additionally, the response also provides these fields below:

|Key|Explanation|Constraints|Example value|
|---|---|---|---|
|`message`|A message for a developer about the status of generated token.|- Max length 100|`"Token created successfully"`
|`authToken`|A unique string for verification process (will be passed as a url parameter when redirecting a client to verification platform).|- Length <= 40|`"3FA5TFPA2ZE3LMPGGS1EGOJNJE"`
|`scanRef`|A unique string identifying a client verification on Mark ID’s side.|- Length <= 40|`"d2714c8a-ec05-11e8-834f-067891e3383a"`

### Examples
#### Example requests

You can choose not to send any data regarding your client that needs to be identified. The only mandatory parameter is **clientId**.
```json
{  
   "clientId":"100000"
}
```
As our only mandatory parameter is **clientId**, however we recommend that you would append at least client’s name and surname if possible. It increases the success rate of verifications.
```json
{  
   "clientId":"100000",
   "firstName":"John Tom",
   "lastName":"Smith"
}
```
Specify all of the parameters for full control.

   "firstName":"John Tom",
   "lastName":"Smith",

### Sending a request with custom settings

You can generate a token with customizable settings, such as liveness face detection, instructions, attempt count, etc. simply by adding the available parameters to your token generation request body.


The default values of the settings depend on the environment's configuration. You can freely contact our support team using your Dashboard account to inquire about current and available settings, some of them have to be included in your contract before it can be enabled.

Our sales team at sales@markid.lt will be happy to answer contract related questions and possibilities of including additional services to your environments.

Please find the full available list of settings below:

|Setting|Type|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|`checkLiveness`|Bool|Indicates whether to add liveness face detection to the generated token or not.|
|`reviewSuccessful`|Bool|Indicates if Mark ID manual review team should review successful verifications after the automatic processing.|
|`reviewFailed`|Bool|Indicates if Mark ID manual review team should review failed verifications after the automatic processing.|
|`driverLicenseBack`|Bool|An option to allow uploading back side of the driver's license in the verification session.|
|`autoAmlMonitoring`|Bool|An option to automatically add the verified person to AML monitoring.|
|`fraudServices`|List|Specify a fraud service to check for the verification. <br/> Possible values:<br/>`AML_NAMES_CHECK`<br/> `LID`<br/> `AML_NEWS`
|`checkIpProxy`|Bool|An option to check if an IP proxy was used for verification.|
|`maxAttemptCount`|Integer|Indicates how many times the user can retry the verification after the automatic processing fails. For example, with this number set as 0, the client must succeed on the first try, with this number set as 3, the client will be able to retry 3 more times after failing on the first attempt.|
|`checkFaceBlacklist`|Bool|Check if this verification's selfie is added to your environment's face blacklist. If there will be any matches, the verification will be suspected|
|`checkDocFaceBlacklist`|Bool|Check if this verification's document photo is added to your environment's face blacklist.|
|`checkDuplicateFaces`|Bool|Check if there is already a verification of the same person's face in your environment.|
|`checkDuplicateDocFaces`|Bool|Check if there is already a verification of the same person's document face in your environment.|
|`nfcRequired`|Bool|Option to require NFC as a method for verification.|
|`faceMatchingThresholdModifier`|Float/Integer|This setting adjusts the sensitivity for the face matching algorithm. Please keep in mind that the default value is set at 1, which is tested and most optimal.|
|`levenshteinTextMatchRatio`|Float/Integer|This setting adjusts the Levenshtein matching ratio that is used for string comparison and searches for inconsitencies between them. The technology behind this method can be found on the web, for example - [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). The default setting is already in tested and optimal value - 0.8|
|`levenshteinMrzMatchRatio`|Float/Integer|This setting adjusts the Levenshtein matching ratio for document's MRZ. The technology principle is the same as `levenshteinTextMatchRatio` but used separately for MRZ. The default setting is already in tested and optimal value - 0.7|
|`checkUrjanet`|Bool|This option is turned on for utility address check.|
|`detectionTypes`|List[String]|Specifies the priority for detection in selfie processing for mobile users.<br/> Possible values: <br/>`FACE`<br/>`EYES`

{: .important }
> None of the above parameters are mandatory, and they have to be turned on in your environment's configuration before you can pass a specific option parameter in your token generation request.
> 
> If the option is turned on in the configuration, they will be active for all of the generated tokens, unless you specify othwerise with the above parameters.
> 
> As a result, these options will give you more freedom in customizing our services and applying them in more different scenarios.
> 
> Please keep in mind that some of these parameters are already in optimal and tested settings. Use at your own risk.



{: .note }
> In case of a malformed JSON body or API key/secret mismatch you will receive a standard Mark ID API error response.
