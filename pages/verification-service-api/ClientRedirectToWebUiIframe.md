# Client redirect to WEB UI iFrame
### Redirect action

If you wish to have an iFrame implementation â€“ there is a slightly different approach. You will have to directly insert verification platform URL (https://ui.markid.eu/  ) with **authToken** query string parameter into your iframe tag. The **authToken** can be retrieved after [generating a token](/pages/verification-service-api/GeneratingIdentificationToken).


The main difference between the regular redirect and iframe implementation is that in iframe, the user can remain in your webpage and complete the verification without opening any additional browser windows.

The company's logo does not show up inside the verification session's UI in iframe.

After the process is finished, you may close the iframe and display a desired page to your client.


:::important 
* Do not use `successUrl`, `errorUrl`, `unverifiedUrl` in [token generation](/pages/verification-service-api/GeneratingIdentificationToken)
for iframe implementation. Using the mentioned parameters may break the flow.

* Locale parameter in token generation will have no effect in iFrame.

* To force the iFrame to use a locale, append `"lang=<alpha-2-country-code>"` URL parameter.

Please find the available locales and examples below.
